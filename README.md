# Book Search

There's a design doc at this level (Design.md), and everything else is in either book-search or book-search-ui.

1. To run, the UI first needs to be built, which should work following the instructions in book-search-ui/README.md
2. Following that, follow the directions in book-search-fastapi/README.md to actually run the code.
